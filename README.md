# Challenge

The proposed challenge:
https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/

I've decided to use Hugo rather than write my whole website in html and css.\
Currently testing out [hugo-resume theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-resume/), this still needs a few tweaks but it's good enough for now.

They have a guide specifically for [Terraform](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/extensions/terraform-getting-started/).
